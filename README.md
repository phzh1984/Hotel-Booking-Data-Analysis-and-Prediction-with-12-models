About the Dataset

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and prediction project for hotel booking data. The dataset includes booking information for both a city hotel and a resort hotel, featuring various details such as booking date, length of stay, guest demographics, room types, and more. It is worth noting that all personally identifying information has been removed from the dataset to ensure privacy.

Business Problem

An online travel booking company faces revenue losses due to uncertain booking cancellations. The primary goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to cancel their hotel bookings. By identifying such customers, the company can take proactive measures to minimize losses and optimize revenue.
